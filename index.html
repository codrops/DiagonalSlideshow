					<div class="content__text">Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so much. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.</div>

We don't have anything but happy trees here. Let's do that again. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so much.

					<div class="content__text">See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. This is unplanned it really just happens. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. We'll play with clouds today. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so much.

					<div class="content__text">So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so much. Work on one thing at a time.
